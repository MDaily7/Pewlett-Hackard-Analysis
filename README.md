# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
This project centers on helping a mock company, Pewlett-Hackard, update their methods for storing and utilizing data from Excel to a database system with SQL in order to learn how to make a database and utilize SQL. The project began with the creation of an Entity Relationship Diagram [ERD](https://github.com/MDaily7/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Images/EmployeeDB.png) that depicts the relationship between the tables that would be used to create the database (The ERD was generated with Quick Database Diagrams (DBD)). The tables were created in Postgres using the ERD as a roadmap for defining their relationships between one another, and the data for each table was imported from various CSVs. At this point, various queries were used to generate new tables from the existing ones to isolate particular portions of data. For example, a retirement_info table was created with a query isolating data from another table to only include employees within retirement age([retirement query](https://github.com/MDaily7/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Images/Retirement_info_query.PNG)). The final portion of this project was to create four new tables, one with retiring employees and their titles, one with retiring employees and only their most recent title, a third table with a count of the employees leaving by each title, and finally a table of current employees born in 1965 and therefore eligible for a mentorship program. The results and summary portion of this project will center around the final four tables created.
